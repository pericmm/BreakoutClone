# BreakoutClone
A clone of the famous breakout game with simple graphics made using SDL2.
Can use any polygon as "blocks"

## Level creator
Left click to add point to the current polygon, right click to finish the polygon.

## Controlls
- 'c' - go to level creator
- 'g' - return to gameplay
- 'w' - when in level creator saves currently drawn level to "level.txt"

# Compilation
Need to have SDL2 installed on the system.
Compile using
`g++ main.cpp -lSDL2`
